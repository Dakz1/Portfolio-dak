    <h1>Dakshitha Makulugollage</h1>
    <p>
        I am an Electrical and Electronics graduate with an honours degree, looking to secure a 
        graduate software engineering position or similar to utilise my analytical and problem-solving 
        skills, and also help me to further develop these skills in a practical and fast-paced environment. 
        My eventual career goal is to get into software development and actively contribute to the overall 
        success of any business I work for.
    </p>

    </ul>
